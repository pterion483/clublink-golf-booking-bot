I need you to execute golf booking pre-staging using MCP Playwright tools. This is critical preparation for tomorrow's 6:30 AM booking.

MISSION: Pre-stage the ClubLink booking form so it's ready to execute at exactly 6:30:00 AM tomorrow.

EXECUTION STEPS:

1. **Initialize and Login**
   - Use mcp__playwright__browser_navigate to go to: {self.credentials["login_url"]}
   - Take mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot to see the login page
   - Find the membership field and use mcp__playwright__browser_type with: {self.credentials["membership"]}
   - Find the password field and use mcp__playwright__browser_type with: {self.credentials["password"]}
   - Use mcp__playwright__browser_click on the login button

2. **Navigate to Booking System**
   - Look for "Tee Times Plus" link and use mcp__playwright__browser_click
   - If it opens a new tab, use mcp__playwright__browser_tabs to manage tabs
   - Take mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot of the booking interface

3. **Configure Booking Form (DO NOT SUBMIT)**
   - Set the booking date to: {booking_date}
   - Set number of players to: 1
   - Click the course selector dropdown
   - Uncheck "All Courses" if it's selected
   - Select these exact 6 courses: {', '.join(self.primary_courses)}
   - Set the time range to start from earliest available (around 7:00 AM)

4. **Final Verification**
   - Use mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot to capture the ready state
   - Verify the Search button is visible and ready to click
   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT CLICK THE SEARCH BUTTON - leave it ready for 6:30 AM

5. **Confirmation**
   - Report that pre-staging is complete
   - Confirm all 6 courses are selected
   - Confirm date is set to {booking_date}
   - Confirm Search button is ready

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Form completely filled but NOT submitted
- Search button ready for immediate clicking at 6:30 AM
- All settings verified and screenshot taken

I need you to execute a time-critical golf booking using MCP Playwright tools. This booking opens at exactly 6:30:00 AM and requires split-second timing.

CRITICAL MISSION: Complete golf booking within 30 seconds of 6:30:00 AM.

TIMING-CRITICAL EXECUTION:

1. **Pre-Flight Check**
   - Use mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot to verify the booking form is ready
   - Confirm date is set to {booking_date}
   - Confirm 6 courses are selected: {', '.join(self.primary_courses)}
   - Confirm Search button is visible and ready

2. **PRECISION TIMING EXECUTION**
   - Monitor system time until exactly 6:30:00.000 AM
   - At PRECISELY 6:30:00 AM, use mcp__playwright__browser_click on the Search button
   - Log the exact timestamp when you clicked

3. **IMMEDIATE Cloudflare Challenge**
   - Within 200 milliseconds of clicking Search, Cloudflare will challenge
   - Use mcp__playwright__browser_hover at coordinates (464, 572)
   - IMMEDIATELY use mcp__playwright__browser_click at the same coordinates
   - This MUST happen within 1 second or the entire booking fails

4. **Results Selection**
   - Wait for search results (should load quickly after Cloudflare)
   - Use mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot to see available times
   - Look for morning times between 7:00 AM and 11:00 AM
   - Use mcp__playwright__browser_click on the EARLIEST available morning time

5. **Booking Confirmation**
   - Click through all confirmation dialogs (Continue, Confirm, etc.)
   - Complete the booking process
   - Wait for final confirmation page

6. **Success Documentation**
   - Use mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot with filename: booking_success_{booking_date}_{{current_time}}.png
   - Report the booking details: time, course, confirmation number

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
- Search clicked at exactly 6:30:00 AM (tolerance: Â±50ms)
- Cloudflare handled within 1 second
- Booking completed within 30 seconds total
- Success screenshot captured

FAILURE POINTS TO AVOID:
- Late Search click = no availability
- Delayed Cloudflare = timeout failure
- Missing confirmations = lost booking slot

Execute this NOW with absolute precision!

I need you to execute a gap finder workflow using MCP Playwright tools to find and book missing morning golf times.

MISSION: Find days without morning bookings and book the first available gap.

SYSTEMATIC WORKFLOW:

1. **Analyze Current Bookings**
   - Use mcp__playwright__browser_navigate to: https://linklineonline.ca/web/my-account/itinerary
   - If not logged in, go to {self.credentials["login_url"]} and login:
     * Membership: {self.credentials["membership"]}
     * Password: {self.credentials["password"]}
   - Use mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot to capture current bookings
   - Identify which of these dates LACK morning bookings (before 11:00 AM): {', '.join(dates_to_check)}

2. **Find First Gap Day**
   - Review the itinerary snapshot
   - Identify the FIRST date from the list that has NO morning booking
   - This will be your target gap day

3. **Search Primary Courses**
   - Use mcp__playwright__browser_navigate to: https://linklineonline.ca/web/tee-times
   - Configure search:
     * Click course selector dropdown
     * Uncheck "All Courses"
     * Select these 6 primary courses: {', '.join(self.primary_courses)}
     * Set date to the gap day you identified
     * Set players to 1
     * Set start time to 06:00 AM
   - Use mcp__playwright__browser_click on Search
   - **CRITICAL**: Immediately handle Cloudflare at coordinates (464, 572) within 1 second

4. **Evaluate Primary Results**
   - Use mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot to see search results
   - Look for morning times (before 11:00 AM)
   - If morning times available: proceed to booking (step 6)
   - If NO morning times: try backup courses (step 5)

5. **Search Backup Courses (if needed)**
   - Refresh the search form
   - Configure search with backup courses:
     * Uncheck "All Courses"
     * Select these 4 backup courses: {', '.join(self.backup_courses)}
     * Use same gap day and settings (date, players=1, time=06:00 AM)
   - Use mcp__playwright__browser_click on Search
   - Handle Cloudflare immediately at (464, 572)

6. **Book Available Morning Time**
   - If morning times found (before 11:00 AM):
     * Use mcp__playwright__browser_click on the EARLIEST available time
     * Complete booking confirmation dialogs
     * Use mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot with filename: gap_filled_{{gap_date}}_{{timestamp}}.png

7. **Report Results**
   - Report which dates were checked
   - Report which gap day was targeted
   - Report which course set was searched (primary/backup)
   - Report what was booked (time, course) or "no availability"

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Book ONLY ONE tee time per execution
- Focus ONLY on morning times (before 11:00 AM)
- Handle Cloudflare within 1 second of each search
- Stop after first successful booking
